# Personal Portfolio

A basic personal portfolio created in HTML with some basic CSS including bootstrap showcasing some of my projects and other things that I have done including past work experience and other things. It also tells a little about my personal hobbies and activies that I like to do in my free time. As of this writing (1/2019) it is the main page of corbanha.com though that will change shortly.
